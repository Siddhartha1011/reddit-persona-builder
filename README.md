# Reddit User Persona Scraper & Analyzer
This project allows you to scrape a Reddit user’s public posts and comments, organize the data into manageable text chunks, and then generate a detailed persona analysis using advanced large language models (LLMs) via the Hugging Face Inference API.

# Features:

- Scrapes up to 50 posts and 50 comments from any Reddit user.
- Saves each post/comment as a separate text chunk, including subreddit context.
- Uses the latest LLMs (e.g., Llama 3.2-11B Vision Instruct) to extract insights about the user’s demographics, personality, interests, occupation, communication style, and motivations.
- Outputs a comprehensive persona summary, citing evidence from the user’s Reddit activity.
- Runs efficiently on any machine—no need for local GPU or large model downloads.
