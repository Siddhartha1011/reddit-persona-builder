[COMMENT #5]
Comment: Burning man at the end of the day is majority white, affluent folks who want to have a fun time. Of course there are exceptions, but anyone who’s been out there knows people of color are a minority. 
I can only imagine how it’s become even more so after Covid, with better cell signal and mainstream notoriety. I’ve not been since 2019, but have seen more and more of my rich white acquaintances posting their experiences on IG. 

Just as with any experience in the US, it’ll probably be easier to befriend Asian Americans or a mixed group than a homogenous white group.

I feel it’s easier to make friends during the first half of the week, before sparkle ponies show up. Make friends, get their camp location, and pop by to see if they want to hang.

In terms of gift, doing something which leans into your cultural identity could be a good conversation starter. We used to serve miso soup in deep playa 1AM-4AM, and had some deep engaging conversations there.

But don’t forget radical self reliance. The people you meet there don’t owe you anything, and it’s up to you to make the burn the experience you want.

Welcome home, I gotta get out there again one of these days )’(

Parent Post Title: hi I’m from Shanghai and have been to Burning Man three times, but I still haven’t managed to blend into the parties of my Western friends. Could you give me some advice?
Parent Post Body: I’m male, but you can consider this post as advice for all Chinese participants coming to Burning Man. I believe many people have also met Chinese attendees, so you might have some suggestions. Thank you all!
