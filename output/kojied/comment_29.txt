Parent Post Title: Forward Settle on Deity 
Parent Post Body: I’m playing Aztec on Deity, going for a domination victory but starting with 4 city tradition. I’ve already decided my 4th city is going at the red X, but I can’t decide between the two yellow Xs for my 3rd city. Suggestions? The eastern city has river for hanging gardens &amp; hydro plant, but the western city is on a hill and picks up more luxuries.
