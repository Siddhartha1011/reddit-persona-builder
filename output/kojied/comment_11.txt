[COMMENT #11]
Comment: Rule of thumb is 3 corpse pits for a double burgage plot! I guess it could be 6 pits if you’re going to level them up to tier 3, but honestly at that point you’re likely to be drowning in food it won’t be an issue

Parent Post Title: Veggie plot: How big is too big? Take a look.
Parent Post Body: You can see the non-planted sections of the two large oblong plots.  That means it is too big for the families to work it. The two above it are just the right size to get full production. 

That said the two large plots are generating over 100 veggies each by themselves.  The other two generate about 80 each so even though I have "wasted" space in the large plots, the optimal size is somewhere right in between.
