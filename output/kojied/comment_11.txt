Parent Post Title: If you had to spend one full day eating your way through NYC, what would your breakfast, lunch, afternoon coffee/snack, and dinner be?
Parent Post Body: Imagine you had one full day in NYC with nothing to do but eat. What would your perfect lineup look like?  
I’m talking: breakfast, lunch, afternoon coffee or snack and dinner.

All in one day. Distance between places doesn’t matter. Just your NYC food crawl, even if it takes you from Staten Island to the Bronx and back.

I’m curious what a perfect (and totally indulgent) food day would look like through the eyes of locals.
