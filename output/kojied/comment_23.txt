Parent Post Title: Just laid off. What daytime NYC stuff should I do?
Parent Post Body: I'm a lifelong New Yorker and just got laid off by surprise. What should I do with my jobless interlude? I know there's going to the usually-crowded museums during tourist hours. What else would you do with an involuntary staycation?
