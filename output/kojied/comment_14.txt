Comment: Incredible stuff! How did you maintain character consistency? Did you generate a consistent character image and then use the image-to-video feature?

Parent Post Title: I used AI to create this short film on human cloning (600 prompts, 12 days, $500 budget)
Parent Post Body: **Kira (Short Film on Human Cloning)**

My new AI-assisted short film is here. *Kira* explores human cloning and the search for identity in today’s world.

It took nearly 600 prompts, 12 days, and a $500 budget to bring this project to life. The entire film was created by one person using a range of AI tools, all listed at the end.

The film is around 17 minutes long. Unfortunately, Reddit doesn't allow videos above 15 minutes. I'm leaving the full film [here ](https://youtu.be/gx8rMzlG29Q?feature=shared)in case you want to see the rest.

Thank you for watching!
