Comment: Can’t really discuss this without your strategy. If you’re setting up on the coast over river, your strategy must involve maritime trades. Also means you benefit from other cities being on the coast. It also means you need some navy to protect your shipping routes and coastal cities.

Parent Post Body: I learn a lot when from discussions like these. So I'm coastal, on a hill, one luxury resource, but I'll get dyes soon, plus some river tiles. Some good boosted food tiles with cattle and sheep. Unfortunately no fish.
