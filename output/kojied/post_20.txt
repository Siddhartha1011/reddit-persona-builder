Title: Tracking our individual impacts on the world through ESG ratings

[Mock-up of ESG scores ](https://preview.redd.it/btc0a5nqmhjb1.png?width=632&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13920d7c88791b2579b6167e5fe135a136731ef7)

We've had ESG ratings for decades now, but it hasn't  played a significant role in the eyes of the consumer. Sure it has developed new investing policies and has made some impact from the shareholder side, but as someone who's worked in environmental consulting, I felt that we needed a more direct way of getting ESG ratings into the mass conscience.

**Do you think individuals should be aware of our own ESG rating?**

I feel that companies would take ESG ratings  seriously if consumers changed their purchase behaviors based on the score.

The current method of consumer activism has yielded lackluster results. This is because once the news dies down, consumers forget about the scandal and go back to normal purchasing behavior. In addition, companies aren't really incentivized to make changes, since consumers hear about the scandal, but rarely stay informed about what was done about it.

The first step towards voting with our dollars is to be aware of our current ESG impact. This can be approximated through the ESG score of the companies you are purchasing goods/services from, multiplied by the dollar amount of your purchase. [Sustainalytics](https://www.sustainalytics.com/) has a comprehensive ESG rating for most public companies. For purchases from businesses that are private (and doesn't have any ESG rating), we can approximate from comparable public companies, or use other indicators (BCorp, Fair Trade, etc.)

Please let me know what you think!

Individual ESG scores could elevate sustainable conscience to another level, which would lead to climate activism on a larger scale.
