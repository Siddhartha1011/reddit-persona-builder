[COMMENT #27]
Comment: He used to shoot well and have impact when no one had him on the radar, and opponents didn’t have him on their scouting report.
Now that there’s pressure to perform, and opponents develop plans on how to deal with him, he’s not doing so well.

Really shows how hard it is to perform when the lights are bright and people are counting on your 3s

Parent Post Title: Can someone explain why Lindy is out there over Kyle?
Parent Post Body: I'm still trying to figure out what Kerr see's in him over Kyle. Spacing? 3 ball? The man is shooting 33%

If you're going to put a brick layer out there, might as well put someone who can actually defend and playmake. Play moody at the 2, and run Kyle at the 3.

It sucks because Kyle would undoubtly provide much more valuable minutes than the ones we get with Lindy and Kerr's dumbass 3 guard roatation...
