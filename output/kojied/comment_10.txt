Parent Post Title: Taking a career break - what regular activities should I try in NYC?
Parent Post Body: I (25M) am planning on taking a break from my corporate job for a few months, decompress and try something different. I am in search of things that happen at a regular cadence (daily/weekly) that could be enriching, help meet people, and/or help me get involved in the city (I live in Gramercy so closer to me the better). I've already enrolled in  adult music classes which I'm really excited for, but wondering if theres other things out there that are free / low cost. I tried volunteering through NYCares which is super cool, but I don't like having to sign up for every individual session. In terms of what kinds of things - I'm pretty open (love sports / cooking / art / music)! All kinds of suggestions are welcome ðŸ™‚
