[COMMENT #10]
Comment: I build my cities close to the borders of others, that way I'm not managing multiple cities at once. The best is building it at the three-way border. That way you're basically managing three cities at once.

Parent Post Title: The ability to Combine Regions or make AI-vassal regions would be nice - I donâ€™t really like controlling more than one city.
Parent Post Body: Eg: MERGE REGION: merges both regions.

Upsides: you gain access to a single unified region, complete with extra perk points and extra Manors, making exploitation of that area easy.

Downsides: your Growth is capped to 1-2 families per month.

VASSALISE REGION: this region is vassalises to a loyal (ai) Retainer. It will provide you with taxes, resources, retinue, and militia, which will slowly grow over time.

Tithing the region higher or lower will significantly affect its growth rate.
