Parent Post Title: How to dispose of/recycle sex toys in NYC
Parent Post Body: I'm looking to get rid of or recycle some sex toys, some of which are rechargeable electronic so contain batteries or electronic components that I can't remove. I looked at guidelines for disposal of [electronics](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02385https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-02385) and [special waste](https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01973) but wanted to know if anybody knew of any more particular resources.
