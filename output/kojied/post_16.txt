Body: 
Subreddit: NYCbike
Subreddit Description: A resource for NYC-specific cycling events and information. Bike news that is not relevant to the New York area should be posted to /r/bicycling or /r/cycling instead. This is a great place to post and find group rides, questions about NYC cycling and bike shops, infrastructure changes, and cycling-related news. New to riding in the city? We'd love to help you get started!
