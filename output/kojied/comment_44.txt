[COMMENT #44]
Comment: I’m hoping people realize after this that it’s not a left or right issue, but rather those with wealth pitting those less fortunate against each other. 
Hopefully we can realize this before it’s too late and develop meaningful solutions

Subreddit Description: We are living in an age of unprecedented wealth, with millions entering the middle class every year. Homo sapiens live longer lifespans than ever before, with better nutrition, and better medicine than ever in our history. This is also the most peaceful time in our history, with record lows in crime and war deaths. The developing world is surging in wealth, and in the “west” we have more opportunity and communication than ever. Our great grandparents would trade places with us in a heartbeat.

Let them eat each other

I’m thinking the next 4 years are going to be an absolute dumpster fire. MAGA thrived on trolling the left last time.

I think engagement from the left may be much less this time around, which only means MAGA will be forced to troll itself.

I've been saying the same thing since the election. MAGA people aren't happy when they win. 

When I saw a lot of liberal voices just sort of disengage in exhaustion and MAGA people complaining about being ghosted by family members, it became pretty obvious they were going to start eating each other. 

They need an enemy that constantly engages with them. When they don't have it, they turn on one another. That's the problem with making common cause out of mutual hatred instead of mutual agreement.
