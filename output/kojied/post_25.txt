Title: Still buying options?
Body: I’ve been trading options for the past month or so, and have made good money. But I’ve realized recently that many put options have become quite expensive, to the point that the market has to crash HARD to make great gains. What’s everyone’s move now, since it seems that the looming economic recession is more “priced in” compared to before?
