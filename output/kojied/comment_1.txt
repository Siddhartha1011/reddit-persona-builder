[COMMENT #1]
Comment: Sorry to hear that man, in the future you may want to have multiple granaries, one close to your berries/deer/fish and one for your veggies/apples/honey.
Also I just store ale at the tavern or keep it in the brewery for this reason

Parent Post Title: My granary burned down
Parent Post Body: I built it next to a well, and it was raining. But there was no saving it and all the food I stored for years. Worst of all, my ale burned up! Now my peasants are sober and hungry
