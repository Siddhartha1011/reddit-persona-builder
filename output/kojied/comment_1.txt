Comment: Does saving and reloading fix it? or just delete and build a new one?

Parent Post Title: Meet Cuntz
Parent Post Body: This young man *(well, not that young anymore)* has been standing in the water holding two planks for about 50 years now. He’s fallen sick over a hundred times, but still kept standing there, which ended up delaying the construction of the mill by half a century - even though the investors only planned for one year.

I tried to build a bridge - not just one, but ten different versions - yet none of them could convince him to finally deliver the planks. In the end, I had to forget about him for a while, since my megacity was beginning to starve.

But then a miracle happened: just as I decided to make a little report about him, maybe even take an interview - he suddenly moved… only to walk straight to the bottom of the river. That’s where he’s decided to stand now. I’ve lost sight of him since - but I still hope to see him again, because it’s been over two years, and the mill is still waiting for its two planks. Which means **Cuntz** must still be alive, still pondering whether to finally deliver them… or wait a bit longer. Maybe the bottom of the river really is the perfect place for him to think.
