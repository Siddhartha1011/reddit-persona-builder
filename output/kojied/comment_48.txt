Parent Post Title: Obvious signs that the rich has come to take ur neighborhood?
Parent Post Body: I’ll start:

1) The second the reno starts on that brownstone, Black Lives Matter and rainbow signs go in the window, even if it’ll be a year before arrival. A “We come in peace” thing 🙄

2) You’ll see hopeless delivery dudes sighing on the streets almost every morning, frantically trying to call them up and buzz em out so they can actually deliver breakfast without losing their job. 

3) They roll down all the blinds when they vacay, so you can’t see their riches. 

4) Dogs, Dogs, Dogs…. And then some more dogs

5) Suddenly your neighborhood, that couldn’t  sell a $5 BEC, can hold more than just a couple of $20 pasta spots, all of them basically right next to each other . 🤷🏻

6) Line at the market or corner coffeeshop is not a line but a chaotic array of people casually standing all over the place, head buried in their phones… confused as to why their order hasn’t been taken yet. 

7) Yoga studios…. And more yoga studios. 

And…..?
