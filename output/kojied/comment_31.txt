[COMMENT #31]
Comment: Venice and Austria are annoying since they buy city states, skewing with the world congress votes. Also Venice spams missionaries like crazyÂ

Parent Post Title: Ranking the AI by how dangerous they are on high difficulties
Parent Post Body: This list is based on my experience with ~2000 hours in the game. Curious what you all think.

**Tier 1: Plays the human meta**

Korea

*Korea often plays a tall traditional/rationalism game and builds wonders, allowing them to snowball an insurmountable science lead*


**Tier 2 - Extremely dangerous wide civs**

Greece

Inca

Iroquois

Russia

Shoshone

*These civs spam cities and take advantage of the AI bonuses. Their biases sync well with victory and tend to lead to balanced approaches with high science, production, a strong military, and opportunistic aggression.*


**Tier 3a - Plays to a key strength**

Brazil

*Brazil plays a strong cultural game which can sync very well with their abilities and AI bonuses. Under the right conditions, they can snowball very effectively by being primed for a specific win condition. Greece also fits in this category, but tends to perform well beyond one victory condition*


**Tier 3b - Dangerous wide civs**

America

China

England

Persia

Poland

Rome

Zulu

*These civs build lots of cities and have biases which help them stay competitive. They can snowball and dominate in many games, but are not as consistently strong as Tier 2*


**Tier 4 - Dangerous early but then fizzle out**

Assyria

Aztecs

France

Huns

Mongolia

Songhai

*These civs are very bold and aggressive warmongers, many of which have strong early game UUs or other advantages. They can ruin your game if they are your immediate neighbour. However, if you survive to the mid game they will often fall behind by focusing too heavily on military, alienating other civs, or expanding too recklessly*


**Tier 5 - Annoying religious civs**

Arabia

Byzantium

Celts

Egypt

Ethiopia

Maya

Spain

*These civs may sometimes be competitive, but most are middle of the pack and focus on religion. This can be very annoying as they spam prophets and may be aggressive against competing religions, but they are usually not a threat to win*


**Tier 6 - Rarely competitive**

Babylon

Germany

Japan

Ottomans

Siam

*These civs are usually uncompetitive but are are almost never the worst performer. They fill space on the map and may be useful trade partners or annoying sub-rivals. Occasionally, in the right conditions, they will perform strongly.*


**Tier 7 - Never competitive**

Austria

Carthage

Denmark

Netherlands

India

Indonesia

Morocco

Polynesia

Portugal

Sweden

Venice


*I have never played a game where these civs meaningfully contended for victory or posed any serious problem at any point. They are either very peaceful or poorly suited to their aggressive tendency. They are often conquered by the civs in Tiers 2, 3b, and 4. Many make excellent neighbours who can either provide a game-long ally and trading partner or a free capital city.*

Thoughts? I ranked Brazil highly not because they often do well but because when they do it escalates to an insurmountable early win.
